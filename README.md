# Steps for Completing the Assignment

## Step 1
Make a github account if you don't have one already.

## Step 2:
Clone this github repository onto your laptop via a terminal, or use google colab, or kaggle...anywhere where you can edit python code. If your laptop doesn't work well, work on https://replit.com/.
There are plenty of online resources which demo how to clone a repo e.g. here: https://www.earthdatascience.org/workshops/intro-version-control-git/basic-git-commands. 
(Notice that you need to install python if you decide to work on your laptop)

## Step 3: 
Edit the tasks.py file by filling in your solution code.
Use the functions, and print the returned outputs, to see whether you have errors.
You can also preview our test cases by running this command in the terminal 
 ```bash
 pip install pytest
 pytest grade_task1.py
 ```
Notice that you shouldn't edit the grading files as those file trigger commit alerts.

## Step 4: 
Push your changes to the repo back to github. The grading will occur automatically but might take a minute.
Again, the add/commit/push workflow of github is explained in various places online: https://www.earthdatascience.org/workshops/intro-version-control-git/basic-git-commands)

## Step 5:
Add this week's kaggle certificate(s) to the repository (course: https://www.kaggle.com/learn/python ; https://www.kaggle.com/learn/pandas). If you received more than one certificate for this week, combine them into one pdf before. Name the file `certificate.pdf`
